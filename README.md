<h2>This is a simple system monitor cmd app. </h2>

<p>Main goal of this app is to get the properties of the system and show them on the screen</p>
<p>I used a library called <a href = "https://github.com/oshi/oshi">OSHI</a> which manages to pull the resources and information about CPU Usage, RAM Usage,OS Ver etc. and gives you an ability to manage and display your resourced data</p>
<p>This is a really begginer level project so feel free to fork this repo and apply some changes, it would be even better if you describe what you changed and why did you do that ⭐️</p>

<h3>Future changes and ideas that are available to do</h3>

  <li>JavaFX GUI</li>
